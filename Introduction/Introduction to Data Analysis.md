# Introduction to Data Analysis

## What is Data Analytics 

* Involves extracting meaningful insights from raw data to drive decision-making processes.
* Includes a wide range of techniques and disciplines ranging from the simple data compilation to advanced algorithms and statistical analysis

## Types of Data Analytics


### Descriptive analystics (What happened?)

Look at what happened in the past. so the rule is to describe what happend. don't explain why happend or give solutions or suggestions just descibe what happend.

An Example is: `Google Analysis`

One of the Main proccessing of Descriptive analystics are:
* **Data aggregation**: means collecting and summarizing data from many sources 
    * Example: combining many rows of sales data to get total sales per month.
* **Data mining**: means finding hidden patterns, relationships, or useful information in large sets of data. so analyzing the data to discover insights.
    * Example: A store use data mining to find that people who buy baby diapers often also buy baby wipes.

### Diagnostic analystics (Why did it happen?)

Dive deeper to understand why something happend. the main purpose is to identify the unexpected outcome from your data

* Example: 
    * Descriptive analysis shows that there was a 20% drop in sales for the month of March.
    * Diagnositc analysis is to show why that happend.

The processing is like the following:
1. examines different data sources like website traffic, user behavior, and checkout data.
2. discover that the number of website visitors is still high and many users are adding items to their shopping carts. but only a few are completing their purchases.
3. perform a drill-down analysis on the checkout process. it will show that most users leave the website while entering their delivery address
4. After testing the checkout page, the analyst finds that the address form fails to load properly on mobile devices, causing customers to abandon their carts.


There are a number of different techniques that you might employ such as:
* probability theory
* regression analysis
* filtering
* time-series analysis
